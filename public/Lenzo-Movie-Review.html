  <h4>Critic Response</h4>
  <p>"When I first heard Denzel was playing the part of Creasy, I missed a couple of heartbeats," 
   but ultimately commended Washington's performance, acknowledging the film's violence and the 
   importance of portraying Creasy's anger effectively."

  <li><a href =  "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Equalizer_(film)" > The Equalizer</a></li>
  <h4>Critic Response</h4>
  <p>"If The Equalizer lacks gravitas, it is fairly sturdy as far as pure entertainment goes."</p>

  <li><a href =  "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Negotiator" > The Negotiator</a></li>
  <h4>Critic Response</h4>
  <p>"Teaming for the first time Kevin Spacey and Samuel L. Jackson, arguably the two best actors of their generation, 
    in perfectly fitting roles is a shrewd move and the best element of this fact-inspired but overwrought thriller."</p>
